The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify the breed of a dog in an image. 
The input to the model will be an image of a dog and the output will be one of the 120 different dog breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. 
The model will be trained on a dataset of dog images and their corresponding breed labels. 
The performance of the model will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify new, unseen images of dogs into the correct breed. 
This project aims to demonstrate the capability of CNNs in image classification tasks and to provide a solution for classifying dog breeds in a fast and efficient manner.
